- You can use ```ctrl + +``` to zoom in your VS code window.

## How does website works?
A website works using 3 types of things.
- Client (Me, you, everyone who uses browser)
- Server (The data is stored in the servers)
- Browser (The thing which displayes the content in a graphical form to the client received from the server)

Example: When you type in ```google.com``` in the address bar, you are a client requesting browser to get the content of google and display it to you(client) in the browser window, and the browser gets the data from the server and displayes to client(you).

- Backend's code is not visible to the user and it is confidential, you will learn more about backend in future tutorials

- **Frontend** is mainly made of 3 languages: **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**
