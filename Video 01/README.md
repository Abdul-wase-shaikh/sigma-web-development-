### Creating Your First HTML File

- Name it whatever you like with a `.html` file extension, for example, `index.html`.

> [!NOTE]  
> The file you create in VS Code will also be created in the folder opened in VS Code.

### Understanding How Websites Work

Websites operate with three key components:

1. **Client**: A person using a web browser.
2. **Server**: Where the website's code is stored.
3. **Browser**: Where you request a website.

In essence, when a client (user) requests a website from the server via a web browser, the server provides the requested website code in HTML, CSS, and JS. The browser then renders this code into a webpage.

### Quick HTML Examples

- In the HTML editor, type `!`, and an Emmet popup will provide you with an HTML boilerplate code.

- Throughout this course, you will explore various HTML tags. For example, you can add a video to your page using:

```html
<video src="video1.mp4"></video>
```

Or you can include audio on your page using:

```html
<audio src="song.mp3" controls></audio>
```
