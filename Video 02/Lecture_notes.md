**HTML File (index.html):**
- **DOCTYPE Declaration:** The document starts with a standard HTML5 declaration.
- **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Character Encoding:** A `meta` tag specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
- **Title:** The `<title>` tag defines the title of the web page as "Sigma Web Development Course."
- **Content:** Inside the `<body>` tag, basic content is added, introducing the website as "my first website" and mentioning the "Sigma Harry bhai ka course."

**JavaScript File (script.js):**
- **Alert:** In the JavaScript file, an `alert()` function is used to display a pop-up message that says "Welcome to Sigma Web Development Course."

**CSS File (style.css):**
- **Styling:** In the CSS file, the background color of the `body` element is set to red, and the text color is set to white.

This video introduces the structure and content of the HTML file, the use of JavaScript to create an alert, and basic styling through CSS. It's the foundation for web development and will be expanded upon in subsequent lectures.
